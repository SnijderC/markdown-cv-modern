### Readme

In my free time I try to keep my knowledge up-to-date by working on side
projects, I like to work with cutting edge technologies and push the boundries.
I would like to apply this knowlegde in my future position.

I would also like to change the environment I work in, as I've only worked in
small companies, I would like to gain experience in a larger enterprise or
perhaps in a fast moving environment such as in a startup.

I see myself as a creative person, both in the sense of finding elegant
solutions for problems as well as enjoying creating something from scratch. I
enjoy the process of laying out the strategy, planning and executing a project.

I live for creation, when I am not at my keyboard, you'll find me building
something physical, with tools in hand. But don't worry I also take my responsibilty
maintaining your existing (legacy) projects, with almost the same enthusiasm.

### Experience

#### _2015 -- current_ Frontend/Backend developer

##### Greenhost

Greenhost offers sustainable hosting and cloud services. As a member of the
developer team, I am responsible for maintaining the customer portal as well as
implementing new features. Aside from the hosting services Greenhost does
projects around human rights funded by grants. During my time with Greenhost I
worked on:

The Greenhost website
: The Greenhost [website](https://greenhost.net), a bilingual static site based
on Middleman, with customisations (in Ruby). The UI was made entirely with hand
crafted CSS (SASS), and makes use of modern CSS features such as
[grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) and [flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Flexbox). And
because Greenhost serves a niche market of privacy
minded customers, the interface is largely functional without JavaScript as well.

Stapled (Lead developer)
: [Stapled](https://github.com/greenhost/stapled), a Python
based daemon for pre-fetching OSCP "staples". OCSP staples are signed temporal
proofs of validity of TLS certificates that can be pushed to clients by a proxy
server. Staples eliminate the need for the client to check the validity of an
TLS certificate, thus increasing performance and preserving privacy.

TOTEM
: [TOTEM](https://totem-project.org) is an edX based MOOC, developed for
journalists and human rights activists, but free for anyone to use. It teaches
digital security and privacy. With a team we developed various edX plugins
(XBlocks) to provide interactivity in course curriculla. Among these plugins
are: a chatbot to teach the use of OTR to encrypt chat messages (Python), a
function TOTP implementation for learning purposes (JavaScript), an edX
integration of [draw.io](https://draw.io) for making interactive network
drawings.

Certbot-HAProxy ([Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/))
: Certbot is the official command line interface tool that allows you to install
valid TLS certificates free of charge. Certbot allows plugins to be created for
proxy servers, it comes with an official plugin for Apache and NGiNX. At
Greenhost uses HAProxy to provide high availability, so we made a plugin to
fetch and install certificates from and to HAProxy.

#### _2014 -- 2015_ Volunteer

##### Bits of Freedom

Dutch digital civil rights organisation Bits of Freedom requested a website
listing digital security and privacy tools, advice and instructions. The "toolbox"
had specific requirements regarding privacy, i.e. no logging, no cookies, not
even sessions, but still required various filtering options. With the help of
Django I set up the website allowing filtering entirely by SEO friendy URIs.

After the initial setup I lead a group of around 30 volunteers with whom I wrote content
for the website.

NB: The
[toolbox](https://web.archive.org/web/20200810104531/https://toolbox.bitsoffreedom.nl/)
has since been replaced by the [fixjeprivacy](https://fixjeprivacy.nl) project,
which I was not a part of.

#### _2009 -- 2015_ System Operator

##### ReleaseTMS

In 2009, ReleaseTMS was still a small start-up. Including myself, ReleaseTMS
had 5 experienced specialists in the field of telecom services. By 2015 it
grew to 15 employees and served hundreds of B2B customers. Their main product
is a SaaS solution that helps reduce teleom costs.

My main tasks were analysing and converting data from many sources to import
into the application. I largely automated the process so I could start
focussing on other challenges in the organisation. Such as product development
for the SaaS solution, designing and programming of several applications for
both internal and external use. Among those I implemented:

- A secure file exchange system with a web interface as well as allowing
  connections from SFTP.
- Several custom telecom cost reporting tools.
- Call cost calculating system for land lines and VoIP calls, rating call costs
  per source, destination, special numbers, international zones and discount
  tables. Based on Python with Django, background tasks, and an intuitive user
  interface based on Bootstrap.

#### _2008 -- 2009_ System administrator
##### 2ml IT Solutions

Network and systemadministration of Windows, Mac and Linux networks for
multimedia organisations, mostly television and advertising.

#### _2006 -- 2008_ Service engineer / system administrator
##### CARD Services B.V.

On-site repairs to Apple computers and system administration mostly for multimedia companies.

#### _2005 -- 2006_ Intern
##### CARD Services B.V.

I did a project assignment on improving and shortening business workflows. And
in the role of service engineer I did repairs to Apple computers.

#### _2005 -- 2005_ Intern
##### Royal Navy div. Radar

Maintenance and modifications of radar systems for marine vessels.
