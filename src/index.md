### Readme

As a creative problem solver, it does not really matter to me what kind of
problem you're trying to solve, or in what field, as long as it's intriguing
and as long as I can use my creativity to find elegant solutions to them. Like
most developers, I enjoy greenfield projects, creating something from scratch,
but I also take my responsibility maintaining or migrating existing projects,
with _almost_ the same enthusiasm.

In my free time I try to keep my knowledge up-to-date by working on side
projects, I like to work with cutting edge technologies and push the boundaries.
I would like to apply and expand this knowledge in a future position.

I enjoy the process of laying out the strategy, planning and executing a
project and have proven to be capable of building entire applications from the
ground up, front- and backend, and integrating it with complex systems and APIs.

### Experience

#### _2021 -- current_ Senior Backend developer

##### Deliverect

Deliverect is a scaleup that makes abstractions to help restaurants and
retailers manage the complex ecosystem of delivery partners such a Thuisbezorgd
(TakeAway), Deliveroo, Uber eats, etc. The service provided by Deliverect
ensures restaurant staff does not have to manually type orders from partners
into their point of sale systems speeding up the process and make it less error
prone. Additionally managing stock and synchronising it across partners systems
means restaurants can never run out of a menu option without partners knowing
about it.
