# markdown-cv-modern

Curriculum vitae written in Markdown, compiled to HTML with modern CSS (grid
based) and converted to PDF. You can optionally use github actions to push it to
a github.io site, or a self hosted location via rsync.

## Make your own..

1. [Fork markdown-cv-modern](https://github.com/snijderc/markdown-cv-modern)
2. Edit `index.md` to contain your work experience, skill, contact info, etc.

Decide whether you want to deploy to github pages, or maybe you want to host it
elsewhere.

If you want to use `github.io`:


1. Make a branch of the main branch of your fork, call it `gh-pages`.
2. If you did this locally, now push the branch back to github, if you did this
   in the Github interface, you should soon see your site at
   `[your=account-name].github.io`.
